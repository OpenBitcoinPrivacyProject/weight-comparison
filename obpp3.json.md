## Criteria list

ID | Description | Comment
--- | --- | ---
OBPPV3-CR01 | Number of clicks required to deviate from the default receiving functionality and generate a new non-ECDH receiving address for an existing wallet | 
OBPPV3-CR02 | Number of clicks required by user to generate a ECDH receiving address (BIP 63 or BIP 47), from the default window/authenticated home page | 
OBPPV3-CR03 | Non-ECDH receiving addresses are hidden from default Receive worflow screens once they have been used | If the wallet client hides used non-ECDH addresses from view by default but allows the user to expose them in default Receive workflow screens e.g. via an 'Unhide' button, it will fail this criterion
OBPPV3-CR04 | Preemptively indicates a loss of privacy when user elects to receive funds at a previously-used non-ECDH address, or prohibits this operation entirely | This is separate from the scenario in which a user accidentally reuses a non-ECDH receiving address as a result of a failure of criterion OBPP-CR03
OBPPV3-CR05 | Number of clicks required to deviate from the default change functionality and receive change at a newly generated address | 
OBPPV3-CR06 | Produces P2SH change addresses when one or more of the spend outputs in a transaction is P2SH | 
OBPPV3-CR07 | Change addresses are hidden from the normal receiving workflow by default to discourage using them as receiving addresses | 
OBPPV3-CR08 | Preemptively indicates a loss of privacy when user elects to reuse change addresses as receiving addresses, or prohibits this operation entirely | A wallet client may pass OBPPV3-CR07 but fail OBPPV3-CR08 by not warning a user when a change address is selected for reuse outside of the normal Receive workflow
OBPPV3-CR09 | When an outgoing transaction must merge inputs, and when mixing is not being used, the transaction constructed in a way that plausibly resembles a mixing transaction | 
OBPPV3-CR10 | Inputs and outputs are ordered in a deterministic manner based on criteria other than the status of outputs as spends or change (BIP 69) | 
OBPPV3-CR11 | Order inputs and outputs via a methodology common to multiple wallets | 
OBPPV3-CR12 | When an input is selected which is part of a set of unspent outputs containing identical scripts (multiple deposits to a single address), every output in the set is added to the transaction | 
OBPPV3-CR13 | All transactions created by the wallet are compliant with BIP 62 | 
OBPPV3-CR14 | Allows the user to send to ECDH addresses (BIP 63 or BIP 47) |

OBPPV3-CR16 | Warns user when sending to a non-ECDH address that the user has sent to before | 
OBPPV3-CR17 | Warns user when sending to a non-ECDH address that has received deposits from any source | 
OBPPV3-CR18 | Number of clicks required by user for inputs/outputs to be mixed with one or more other users |

OBPPV3-CR23 | Avoids creating recurring transactions with outputs of a known value or to a known non-ECDH address | 
OBPPV3-CR24 | Number of clicks required by user to to obtain balance information without leaking their machine identity over the network |

OBPPV3-CR26 | Balance information is obtained by making queries to other network participants that do not include multiple addresses in a specific connection context | 
OBPPV3-CR27 | Balance information is obtained via a method that matches a fraction of the blockchain beyond the addresses belonging to the wallet | 
OBPPV3-CR28 | If balance information is obtained via querying more than one address in a given query, a separate connection context is used for each unique query | 
OBPPV3-CR29 | Provides a visual indication if the balance information is not being obtained through an anonymizing network, including IP address information | 
OBPPV3-CR30 | Number of clicks required by user to route outgoing transactions through an anonymizing network | 
OBPPV3-CR31 | Outgoing transactions are routed through a different entry point into the network than the source of balance information |

OBPPV3-CR34 | Avoids broadcasting outgoing transactions from different identity containers via the same connection context | 
OBPPV3-CR35 | The backup process avoids leaking information about wallet addresses | One wallet client previously generated e-mail alerts whenever a new change address as a result of sending bitcoin.
OBPPV3-CR36 | Wallet avoids leaking information about recipients via an external identity lookup | 
OBPPV3-CR37 | The wallet avoids observably connecting to a known endpoint, such as a wallet provider's domain |

OBPPV3-CR45 | Number of clicks to assign an imported private key into an identity container | 
OBPPV3-CR46 | Avoids creating transactions which contain inputs from different identity containers, except optionally if the user has intentionally overridden this behavior |

OBPPV3-CR49 | Mixing is secure against theft of funds |
